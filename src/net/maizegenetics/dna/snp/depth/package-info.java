/**
 * Support for depth of sequence coverage of genotype calls.
 * Different DNA sequencing approaches often result in high variable depth of sequencing coverage.
 * Coverage can be used to estimate probabilities of homozygous versus heterozygous classes, or
 * to estimate presence/absence variation.
